2.2 How does the softmax action selection method using the Gibbs 
distribution fare on the 10\_armed\_testbed? Implement the method and 
run it at several temperatures to produce graphs similar to those in 
Figure 2.1. To verify your code, first implement the e-greedy 
methods and reproduce some specific aspect of the results in 
Figure 2.1.

\textsc{Solution} Our implementation is in Python. The 
code to reproduce the results of Figure 2.1 is in the file 
Exercise2\_2a.py. An example plot has been included in the file 10\_
armed\_testbed.png. The code for the softmax approach is in the 
file Exercise2\_2b.py. The corresponding plot is in 
softmax.png.
