How does the softmax action selection method using 
the Gibbs distribution fare on the 10-armed testbed? Implement the method and run 
it at several temperatures to produce graphs similar to those in Figure 2.1. To verify 
your code, first implement the e-greedy methods and reproduce some specific aspect 
of the results in Figure 2.1.
